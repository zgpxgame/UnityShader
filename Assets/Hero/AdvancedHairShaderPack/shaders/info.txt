Shaders in root folder are the main shaders, some notes:

* Kajiya and Scheuermann both expect your hairs uv's 
to be laid out in vertical direction to get correct 
highlights -- if your hair is laid out horizontally, consider flipping it or use the uDirection shaders. 

* The textures all share the same uv space for optimization
meaning you cant change the tiling or offset of one texture
with out messing with the others.

*All the shaders should support direct3d 11 now, except
the mobile ones of course

*the shader is mixing alpha blend and alpha cut, you could choose 
one or the other but alpha blend by itself wont sort properly and 
alpha cut wont get you any gradients.
So the idea is to mix it. You use cut for most of the hair and blend 
for the edges. You do get occasional "dirty edges" specially hair on 
top of hair, but the effect works most of the time.
 
In order to get the best quality, you need to get to a high
alpha cut value, something like .9 to .99.You just have to 
make sure that your alpha is very "strong" look at the sample 
one the alpha channel of the diffuse, notice how most of the 
hair is white.
